Genetic Algorithm
===

Genetic optimaization using mutation and crossover.


# Build
```
$ python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

# How to Use
```
# DOMAIN -- list of tuple (min, max)
go = GeneticOptimization(COST_FUNCTION, DOMAIN)

for i in range(ITER_CNT):
    go.next()

# printout (cost value, vector)
print go.score
```

# Example
this example is distribution of the book.

```
